                    <p>More than four years ago, when India’s Hindu nationalist government carved out Ladakh from
                        Indian-administered Kashmir, the regional capital, Leh, erupted in joy. A majority of its voters
                        even cast ballots for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party for fulfilling a long-term demand.
                        They had accused the Kashmir-based leadership of discriminating against the Buddhist-majority
                        Himalayan region, known for its snowcapped peaks and lush grasslands.</p>
